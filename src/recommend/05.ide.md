## IDE

### Atom

Atom is a desktop application based on web technologies. Like other desktop apps, it has its own icon in the dock, native menus and dialogs, and full access to the file system.

Open the dev tools, however, and Atom's web-based core shines through. Whether you're tweaking the look of Atom's interface with CSS or adding major features with HTML and JavaScript, it's never been easier to take control of your editor.

Download from Atom's official [download oage](https://atom.io/), or, for Linux, use the script written by [Dragos Cirjan](https://github.com/dragoscirjan/mylin2)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragoscirjan/mylin2.git /opt/mylin2 && \
