## Using Git



### Saving Credentials

We do not recomment storing credentials more than one hour on any computer. So please use the following.

``` bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'
```

For windows, we do accept `wincred` as well, however `cache` should work as well.

```shell
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

For removing credentials - best use the credential helper unset command, after which use again the credential helper set command.

```bash
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```
