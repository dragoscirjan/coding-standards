# Overview

## Scope

This document provides guidelines for code formatting and documentation to individuals and teams contributing to [Foo Company LTD](http://company.foo/) products. Many developers using [Foo Company LTD](http://company.foo/) products have also found these coding standards useful because their code's style remains consistent with all [Foo Company LTD](http://company.foo/) products code. It is also worth noting that it requires significant effort to fully specify coding standards.

**Note**: Sometimes developers consider the establishment of a standard more important than what that standard actually suggests at the most detailed level of design. The guidelines in [Foo Company LTD](http://company.foo/) products' coding standards capture practices that have worked well on the [Foo Company LTD](http://company.foo/) products project.

**Note**: Mainly [Foo Company LTD](http://company.foo/) is a [PHP](http://php.net/) company, thus all documentation written further will be developed over [PHP](http://php.net/) coding language.
