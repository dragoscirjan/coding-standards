##Nesting

Nesting is handy, _sometimes_, but will quickly conflict with our **Specificty** and **Performance** guidelines.

As we follow conventions and thoughts from popular and widely accepted methodologies such as BEM, SMACSS and SUIT, the
use of the Suffix can help immensely though.

* Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
* [Parent Selector Suffixes](http://thesassway.com/news/sass-3-3-released#parent-selector-suffixes) are neat, but not
very searchable
* Watch your output, be mindful of **Specificty** and **Performance**
* Aim for a maximum depth of just 1 nested rule

## @extend or @include

* Excessive use of `@include` can cause unnecessary bloat to your stylesheet, but
gzip should help with that.
* Excessive use of `@extend` can create large selector blocks (not helpful in web inspector)
and hoisting of your selector can cause override and inheritance issues.
* We advise to `@include` over `@extend` generally, but use common sense. In situations where it's better to  `@extend` it's safer to do so on a placeholder selector.

> **Do:**
> Make use of placeholder selectors to separate repeated local styles

```css
%placeholderSelector {
    background-color: #eee;
}

.component1 {
    @extend %placeholderSelector;
    color: red;
}

.component2 {
    @extend %placeholderSelector;
    color: blue;
}
```
