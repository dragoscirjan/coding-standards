##Pseudo Elements and Classes
Pseudo elements and classes are very different things, as is the syntax used to declare them. Declare pseudo
_**classes**_ with a single colon. Declare pseudo _**elements**_ with a double colon.

```css
.component:focus {
    ...
}

.component:hover {
    ...
}

.component::before {
    ...
}

.component::after {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
.component:after {
    ...
}*/
```
