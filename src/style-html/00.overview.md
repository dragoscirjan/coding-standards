# Coding Standards (HTML/CSS)

## Overview
Strictly adhere to the agreed-upon style guide listed below. The general principle is to develop DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself) SCSS, built around reusable components and patterns.

* All code should look like a single person has typed it.
* Don't try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
* When building a component, always start by looking at existing patterns.
* Break down complex components until they are made up of simple components.
* Save your complex components as patterns so they can be easily reused.
* Build your component as a mixin which outputs _optional_ css.
