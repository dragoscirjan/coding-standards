##Units

* Use `rem` units as primary unit type. This includes:
    * Positioning (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`)
    * Dimensions (Such as `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`)
    * Font size
* Use `px` units as primary unit type for the following properties:
    * Border widths (`border: 1px solid #bada55;`)
* Use `%` units only if necessary, where `rem` will not suffice:
    * Positioning (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`)
    * Dimensions (`width`, `height`)
* Line-height should be kept unit-less. If you find you're using a line-height
with a set unit type, try to think of alternative ways to achieve the same outcome.
If it's a unique case which requires a specific `px` or `rem` unit, outline the
reasoning with comments so that others are aware of its purpose.
* Avoid all use of magic numbers. Re-think the problem. (`margin-top: 37px;`)
