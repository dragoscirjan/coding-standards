## Specificity

On large code bases, it's preferable and a tonne more maintainable if the specificity of selectors are all as equal and
as low as humanly possible.

Use classes in your SCSS for styling. **Do not** use ID's for styling. There is literally no point in using them.

<!-- --lang-ex -->

##### Css

```css
.component {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
#component {
    ...
}*/
```

##### Less

```less
.component {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
#component {
  ...
}*/
```

##### Sass

```css
.component {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
#component {
    ...
}*/
```
<!-- --lang-ex-end -->

Style the base elements (such as typography elements). **Do not** reference or style descendent elements in your class
selectors.

<!-- --lang-ex -->

##### Css

```css
h1 {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
.component h1 {
    ...
}*/
```

##### Less

```less
h1 {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
.component {
    & h1 {
        ...
    }
}*/
```

##### Sass

```css
h1 {
    ...
}

/* DON'T
.component h1 {
  ...
}*/
```

<!-- --lang-ex-end -->


Use overqualified selectors in your CSS is not recommended. Do not prepend a class or ID with an element.

```css
div.container {
    ...
}
```

#### Performance

Overly specific selectors can also cause performance issues. Consider:

<!-- --lang-ex -->

##### Css

```css
ul.user-list li span a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

##### Less

```css
ul.user-list {
    li {
        span {
            a:hover {
                color: red;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Sass

```css
ul.user-list li span a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

<!-- --lang-ex-end -->

Selectors are resolved right to left, exiting when it has been detected the selector does not match. This requires a lot
of DOM walking and for large documents can cause a significant increase in the layout time. For further reading checkout:

If we know we want to give all `a` elements inside the `.user-list` red on hover we can simplify this style to:

<!-- --lang-ex -->

##### Css

```css
.user-list-link:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

##### Less

```less
.user-list-link {
    &:hover {
        color: red;
    }
}
```

##### Sass

```css
.user-list-link:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

<!-- --lang-ex-end -->
