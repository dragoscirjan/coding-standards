## Utilities

Utility classes are low-level structural and positional traits. Utilities can
be applied directly to any element; multiple utilities can be used together;
and utilities can be used alongside component classes.

Utility classes should be used sparingly, lean towards component level styling
to make for as reusable HTML patterns as possible.


<a name="u-utilityName"></a>
#### u-utilityName

Syntax: `u-<utilityName>`

Utilities must use a camel case name, prefixed with a `u` namespace.
