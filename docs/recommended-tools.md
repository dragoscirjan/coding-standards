# PHP Recommended Tools

## IDE

### JetBrains PhpStorm

PhpStorm’s smart code editor provides excellent support for PHP (including the latest language versions and frameworks), HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, and many other languages. Enjoy coding with intelligent context-aware code completion, error detection, and on-the-fly code inspections & fixes.​

Consdering JetBrains description, and what we were able to develop with it until now, we consider PhpStorm by far the best Php editor in the market.

Download from JetBrains official PhpStorm [download oage](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/), or, for Linux, use the script written by [Dragos Cirjan](https://github.com/dragoscirjan/mylin2)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragoscirjan/mylin2.git /opt/mylin2 && \
  bash /opt/mylin2/ide/phpstorm.sh -i
```

### Atom

Atom is a desktop application based on web technologies. Like other desktop apps, it has its own icon in the dock, native menus and dialogs, and full access to the file system.

Open the dev tools, however, and Atom's web-based core shines through. Whether you're tweaking the look of Atom's interface with CSS or adding major features with HTML and JavaScript, it's never been easier to take control of your editor.

Download from Atom's official [download oage](https://atom.io/), or, for Linux, use the script written by [Dragos Cirjan](https://github.com/dragoscirjan/mylin2)

```bash

```

### Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.
