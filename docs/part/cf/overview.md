# Overview

## Scope

This document provides guidelines for code formatting and documentation to individuals and teams contributing to [IT Media Connect](http://itmediaconnect.ro/) products. Many developers using [IT Media Connect](http://itmediaconnect.ro/) products have also found these coding standards useful because their code's style remains consistent with all [IT Media Connect](http://itmediaconnect.ro/) products code. It is also worth noting that it requires significant effort to fully specify coding standards.

**Note**: Sometimes developers consider the establishment of a standard more important than what that standard actually suggests at the most detailed level of design. The guidelines in [IT Media Connect](http://itmediaconnect.ro/) products' coding standards capture practices that have worked well on the [IT Media Connect](http://itmediaconnect.ro/) products project. You may modify these standards or use them as is in accordance with the terms of our [Â» license](https://github.com/itmc/docs-license/new-bsd.md).

Topics covered in [IT Media Connect](http://itmediaconnect.ro/) products' coding standards include:

* [File Formatting](file-formating.md)
* [Naming Conventions](naming-conventions.md)
* [Coding Style](coding-style.md)
* [Recommended Tools](recommended-tools.md)

**Note**: In this section we will debate coding standards related to [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) [ColdFusion](overview.md) programming language, treating both ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) and ColdFusion Scripting Language (CFScript) whether if they run on [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html)&copy; [ColdFusion Server](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html), [Railo](http://www.getrailo.org), [Lucee](http://lucee.org) or [OpenBD](http://openbd.org).

**Note**: Please note that this coding standards where written first for [PHP](../../overview.md) and than addapted for multiple languages, including [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) [ColdFusion](overview.md).

## Goals
Coding standards are important in any development project, but they are particularly important when many developers are working on the same project. Coding standards help ensure that the code is high quality, has fewer bugs, and can be easily maintained.
