# File Formatting

## General

**TODO**

## Indentation

Indentation should consist of 4 spaces. Tabs are not allowed.

### Maximum Line Length
The target line length is 80 characters. That is to say, [__COMPANY_NAME__](http://__COMPANY_URL__/) developers should strive keep each line of their code under 80 characters where possible and practical. However, longer lines are acceptable in some circumstances. The maximum length of any line of [PHP](http://php.net/) code is 120 characters.

### Line Termination
Line termination follows the Unix text file convention. Lines must end with a single linefeed (LF) character. Linefeed characters are represented as ordinal 10, or hexadecimal 0x0A.

**Note**: Do not use carriage returns (CR) as is the convention in Apple OS's (0x0D) or the carriage return - linefeed combination (CRLF) as is standard for the Windows OS (0x0D, 0x0A).

*Thus said, please configure your IDEs accordingly.*

## Note

For simplifying the trouble of configuring your IDEs, you could always use the [.editorconfig](../../../raw/master/.editorconfig) file based on [» http://editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org).
